# pymarket

pymarket is (or will be) a centralised order-book style market capable of handling limit and market orders. Clearing and settlement will be handled by a centralised ledger (centralised counterparty). An optional server model will allow orders to be placed via sockets (on the same machine or over a network), alternatively you can just write directly to the order queue file. 

# Why?

As a hobby and for my own education. However with some adaptation it could also be used:

* in a game, as the core of an economic system
* in a simulation
* as a learning/classroom exercise
* to allocate/trade actual things

Bear in mind that pymarket currently has NO input validation, security, anything like that. DO NOT use on anything important or public-facing at the moment. 

# Get involved

I know pretty much nothing about network programming so help would be appreciated here!
